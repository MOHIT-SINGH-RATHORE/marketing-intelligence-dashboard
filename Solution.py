'''Assessment 1 : Marketing Intelligence
Dashboard / Reporting
Context
You are given four datasets capturing 120 days of daily activity:
● Facebook.csv, Google.csv, TikTok.csv → Campaign-level marketing data (date, tactic,
state, campaign, impression, clicks, spend, attributed revenue).
● Business.csv → Daily business performance data (orders, new orders, new customers,
total revenue, gross profit, COGS).
These datasets represent the marketing and business footprint of an e-commerce brand.
Task
Your job is to design, build, and host an interactive BI dashboard that helps a business
stakeholder make sense of how marketing activity connects with business outcomes.
You are expected to:
● Explore and prepare the datasets (join, aggregate, derive metrics as needed).
● Decide which analyses, metrics, and visualizations matter most.
● Apply good principles of data visualization and storytelling so that insights are clear
and actionable.
● Use your product thinking to determine what a decision-maker would want to see, not
just what the data contains.
You are free to use any BI / visualization tool (e.g., Streamlit, Dash, Power BI, Tableau, Looker
Studio, etc.).
What You Will Be Evaluated On
1. Technical Execution
○ Ability to clean, combine, and structure the data effectively.
○ Correctness and efficiency in handling joins, aggregations, and derived metrics.
2. Visualization & Storytelling
○ Quality of charts and dashboard layout.
○ Use of best practices (clarity, relevance, minimal clutter, appropriate chart
choices).
○ Whether the dashboard tells a coherent story.

3. Product Thinking
○ Are you surfacing insights that a business or marketing leader would care about?
○ Do your choices reflect an understanding of how marketing and business data
should interact?
○ Do you demonstrate curiosity by going beyond surface-level reporting?
4. Delivery
○ Speed of execution and ability to ship a working hosted dashboard.
○ Professionalism and usability of the final output.

Note
You are encouraged to leverage LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) to explore possible use
cases of such datasets and to enrich your approach.
